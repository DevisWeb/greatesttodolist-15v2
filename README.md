# Challenges

- Thinking about architecture and transform different ideas of a team into code
- Teams will rotate to another teams project in week 2. Challenge:
  - work with code and documention of other teams on a similar project
  - see how and if another team is able to work with your project / documention
  - therefore: projects need readable commits and well structured comments in the project code
